        <h3>Limitations of Liability:</h3>
        <p>
          Bytewave or its associated clients won't be liable to you for any
          damages that arise from your using the Services. This includes if the

        <p>
          If Bytewave doesn't exercise a particular right under these Terms,
          that doesn't waive it or allow you to assume your actions are
          acceptable. Any questions regarding use should be directed to the
          support@metaclean.pro email address.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any provision of these terms is found invalid by a court of
          competent jurisdiction, you agree that the court should try to give
          effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision and
          that other provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect.
        </p>
        <h3>Choice of Law and Jurisdiction:</h3>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by Wyoming state law, without reference to
          its conflict of laws provisions. You agree that any suit arising from
          the Services must take place in a court located in Cheyenne, Wyoming.
        </p>
        <p>
          These Terms (including any document incorporated by reference into
          them) are the whole agreement between Bytewave and you concerning the
